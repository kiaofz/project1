# Challenge #1

The goal of this challenge is to start thinking in
abstractionsâ€”layering your code so that each layer builds on the one
below.

It might help to think of the problem in terms of words:

* I need to find a word that contains xxx.

This can become

* I need to:

  1. read the dictionary and 
  2. for each word
     2.1 check to see if a word matches the pattern xxx.
     
So now you're looking at at least two methods/functions, and some kind
of loop. 

Then, for each of the steps, break it down the same way. Continue
until you have something expressible as one or two lines of code.


## Problem 1

The file `words.txt` contains about 8900 words, one per line.

1. Write a program to find the first word that contains the letters
   "a", "b", and "c" in that order, potentially separated by other
   layers. (Hint: the answer is "abstract")
   
2. Write a program to find the first word that contains the letters
   "l", "m", and "n" in that order, potentially separated by other
   layers.
   
3. Write a program that takes three letters from the user and finds
   the first word that contains those three in order.
   

# Problem 2

4. Write a program to find the all the words that contains three sets of
   duplicated letters (there are 4 of them).

# Problem 3

5. Write a program that prints the longest word.

# Problem 4

6. Write a problem that prints a table showing the frequencies of word
   lengths:
   
       Word length      Count
         4                xxx
         5                yyy
